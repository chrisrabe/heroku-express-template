# Heroku Express App Template

## Description
Heroku has their own 'getting started' repository for express but it does not have the proper architecture (like a folder which has routes, and the appropriate middleware). In this repository, I've combined the features of the template express code produced by the express generator and the heroku getting started repository. I personally will be using this a lot. I just thought I'd make it open source for those who's having the same issues.
